# Cubic-Spline-Interpolation

A Java implementation of a cubic spline interpolation and mapping program for FTC robotics. Compatible with odometry functions for smoother and more efficient path construction. Graphing powered by JFree charts.

# Instructions

Input: Enter the N number of points followed by the points themselves.
Output: A extrapolated cubic spline equation connecting all N points along with a graph displaying the spline path.

Sample Input:
