# Cubic-Spline-Interpolation

A Java implementation of a cubic spline interpolation and mapping program for FTC robotics. Compatible with odometry functions for smoother and more efficient path construction.

# Instructions

Enter the n number of points followed by the points themselves.

Sample Input:

```
3
1 2
3 4
5 1
```

Output:
A extrapolated spline connecting those three points using a cubic polynomial, followed by a graph showing the curve.
